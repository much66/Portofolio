### 📂 Python: Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Project Link | Associated | Area | Library | Project Description 
---|---|---|---|---
💰 [Housing Prices Regression]( coming soon )|Startup Campus: Data Science| Data Wraggling, EDA, Supervised Learning - **Regression** |pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy |Conducted data cleansing on raw housing price data and analyzed over 80 features using statistical methods for feature selection. The best model achieved an accuracy of 91.6% using Random Forest Regression for housing price prediction.
☎️ [Banking Stocks Price Forecasting]( coming soon )|Startup Campus: Data Science [*Team*]|Data Wraggling, EDA, Supervised Learning - **Forecasting**| pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, shap | Developed a forecasting model to predict the next 7 periods for 12 banking stocks, analyzing Value at Risk (VaR) and Volatility. The final ranking was based on stocks with the lowest VaR and Volatility, achieving an error range of 5-28%.
📲 [Heart Disease Classification]( coming soon )|Private Project by Startup Campus| Data Wraggling, EDA, Supervised Learning - **Classification**|pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, shap, etc| Developed a heart disease classification model using Random Forest, achieving 96% accuracy with features like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more to predict heart disease presence (1) or absence (0).
🙂 [Customer Segmentation for Marketing Strategy Optimization]( coming soon )| Private Project by Startup Campus |Data Wraggling, EDA, Unsupervised Learning - **Clustering** |pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, yellowbrick | Analyzed customer characteristics of a e-grocery store by creating a clustering model using K-means. Before to clustering, decomposition was performed, and the best cluster was determined using inertia score or distortion score. This resulted in 4 clusters based on customer behavior, considering factors such as the number of transactions, spending levels, response to campaigns, and website visit frequency.
🏬 [Weather Prediction for Automated Pesticide Spraying]( coming soon )| Private Project | Data Wraggling, EDA, **Forecasting** | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn | Analyzing the impact on pest control effectiveness and crop health through data visualization in Python. Identified patterns in pest infestation, pesticide usage, and crop yield improvements, leading to actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing agricultural practices.
